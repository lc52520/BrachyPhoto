Bradi3g15490.v3.1,BBX28,,,AT4G27310B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN 28: BBX28 Encodes a B-box domain protein that negatively regulates photomorphogenic development by interfering with the binding of the transcription factor HY5 to target gene promoters. Degradation of BBX28 in darkness is dependent on COP1 and occurs via the 26S proteasome pathway. BBX28 acts as a key factor in the COP1-HY5 regulatory hub by maintaining proper HY5 activity to ensure normal photomorphogenic development in plants.
